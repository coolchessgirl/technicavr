Rachel Naidich and Hanna Xu's Technica Hackathon VR Projet

Inspiration: 
We both love to exercise, but we found that it can be really boring sometimes. After doing some research, we found that obesity is currently a huge global problem, and it can lead to serious diseases like arthritis, stroke, and heart disease. We also found that many current exercise methods are either boring or ineffective, and exercise video games don't provide optimal workouts because they don't track the user's heart rate.

What we built:
We built a virtual reality video game system that would solve this problem by creating a fun virtual world for the user to run around and exercise in. It is a first-person shooter game, and it uses an Oculus Rift to create an enjoyable, immersive experience for the user. The beginning of the game includes calculations of the user's target heart rate zone using the user's age. The heart rate monitor bar in the game would track the user's heart rate, impact the user's health, and provide an incentive for the user to keep their heart rates up.

How we built it:
We used the Unity Game Engine to build the game, we programmed the game in C#, we used an Oculus Rift for virtual reality, and we used two mice and an Xbox controller for the user input.
